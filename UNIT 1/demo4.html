        </p>
        <h3>Breed</h3>
        <p>Toby is a Havanese x Cockapoo. He is black and white, with a giant pink tongue. He has mostly Cockerspaniel 
            <br> and Havanese characteristics, and barely looks like a poodle. He has very short legs, but a huge personality to make
            <br> up for his size. 
            <br>
            <br> He weighs about 23 lbs and is very compact. He is sturdy and can knock someone down if he runs too quickly.
