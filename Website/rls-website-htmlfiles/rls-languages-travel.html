            <h3 class="explorations-title1">Adventures in the BC and Alberta</h3>

            <p class="explorations-text">
                In the summer of 2025, my friend Merit—visiting from the Netherlands—joined me for an unforgettable road trip across British Columbia and Alberta. We kicked things off in Victoria before heading through the warm valleys of the Okanagan and then making our way into the towering Rocky Mountains. We camped in Revelstoke, Field, and Nakusp, spending our days surrounded by massive peaks and cool alpine air. In Revelstoke, we swam in crystal-clear mountain lakes—refreshing, cold, and absolutely worth it.<br> <br>
                We explored several national parks, including Jasper National Park, where we wandered through glacier valleys and took in views that felt almost unreal. Of course, no adventure is complete without a few surprises: at one point our car battery died, turning a simple stop into a mini-adventure of its own as we sorted out how to get moving again.<br><br>
                We wrapped up the mountain portion of the trip in Nakusp, just as a dramatic summer storm rolled in. Between bursts of rain and thunder, we soaked in both the natural hot springs and the Nakusp Hot Springs. <br><br>
                Our final stop was Vancouver for whale watching. When Merit visited 11 years ago, we didn't spot any whales, but this time we finally did—an incredible ending to a trip filled with mountains, lakes, mishaps, and memories we'll be talking about for years.<br><br>

            <h3 class="explorations-title1">Bike Trip in the Netherlands</h3>

            <p class="explorations-text-right">
            In May 2025, my friend Alisha and I set off on a memorable adventure through the Netherlands and Croatia—her very first time in Europe. We began our trip in the Netherlands at the Keukenhof, wandering through the famous flower gardens. Even though most of the tulip fields had already finished blooming for the season, the colours and displays were still beautiful to experience.<br><br> 
            From there, we travelled to The Hague, where our bike journey officially began. We visited Scheveningen, enjoying the sweeping views of the coast and the lively atmosphere of the city before pedalling our way toward quieter towns and countryside paths. Along the route, we stopped in Vleuten and Houten to visit friends, soaking up the laid-back charm of Dutch suburban life.<br><br>
            Alisha dove right into local cuisine—pannenkoeken, stroopwafels, kroketten, and plenty of Dutch cheese quickly became essentials of the trip. We ended our adventure in Amsterdam, where our friend Merit joined us for a day of exploring the canals, cafes, and busy streets.<br><br>
            It was a wonderful trip filled with family, friends, and countless bike paths. And if this journey proved anything, it’s that biking is absolutely the best way to experience the Netherlands.<br><br>

            <h3 class="explorations-title1">Exploring Croatia - Split & Beyond</h3>

            <p class="explorations-text">
            In May 2025, my friend Alisha and I spent a week exploring the stunning coastline of Croatia, basing ourselves in the historic city of Split. From wandering the streets of the Old Town to relaxing along the waterfront promenade, the city quickly won us over with its charm, food, and easygoing atmosphere.<br><br>
            Even though it rained for a good part of the week, we still made the most of every day. One of the highlights was taking a ferry out to the island of Hvar, where we explored the picturesque harbour, climbed up to the hilltop fortress, and enjoyed the quieter pace of island life in between patches of sunshine.<br><br>
            Another unforgettable stop was Krka National Park. Despite the grey weather, the waterfalls were absolutely spectacular; cascading turquoise water, lush greenery, and dramatic cliffs all around. It was one of those places that instantly felt magical.<br><br>
            Rain or not, the trip turned into a beautiful mix of good food, island views, and memorable moments. Croatia was full of surprises, and Split made the perfect home base for our week of adventure.
