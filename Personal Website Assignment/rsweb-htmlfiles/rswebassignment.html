            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Rowan—part Dutch, part Canadian, and 100% obsessed with languages, culture and how they're connected.
                <br>
                <br>I'm passionate about language learning and language revitalization and I spend a lot of time thinking about how language connects to memory, identity and community. My academic and personal interests often overlap, especially when it comes to community-based research and exploring how people remember and tell their stories.
                <br>
                <br>As an aspiring polyglot, I speak English, Dutch, and French fluently, hold a certificate in Spanish language and culture, and am currently expanding my linguistic horizons with Catalan, Portuguese, and Indonesian.
                <br>
                <br>I'm also someone who loves learning new things, whether that's diving into a new language, exploring design or taking on creative challenges. Alongside my language work, I'm passionate about web design and I'm currently expanding my skills by learning to code through the Circuit Stream Software Development Bootcamp to bring even more creativity and functionality to my projects.
                <br>
                <br>When I'm not studying or working, you'll probably find me skiing, hanging out with my dog or enjoying time with friends … ideally somewhere with a good view and even better conversation.

                    <br><br>In May-June 2023, I participated in the <a href="https://www.eucanet.org/nov-8th-at-uvic-europe-memory-politics-study-tour-2023-information-session/">European Memory Politics Study Tour</a>, organized by the <a href="https://www.eucanet.org/projects/memory-politics/">University of Victoria's European Memory Politics Jean Monnet Network</a>. Over the course of three weeks, I traveled to Vienna (Austria), Budapest (Hungary), Kraków and Oświęcim (Poland), and Trieste (Italy) to explore how European countries commemorate and politically utilize modern history, particularly the Holocaust. The tour included visits to former concentration and death camps, museums, and memorials, providing an immersive experience in experiential learning. I engaged with scholars, activists, and community members, participated in the <a href="https://rc2s2.elte.hu/en/eumepo-conference-budapest-2023-program/">Memory Politics in Europe conference in Budapest</a>, and <a href="https://www.eucanet.org/slovenian-student-activists-in-vienna/">collaborated with fellow students on projects</a> related to memory and identity. This experience deepened my understanding of memory politics and its impact on contemporary society.
